## 🏗️ Building project
Its important to build the project (step 2) as it is needed for loading the assets correctly in the game.

2. Build the projects (Very important or else the assets isn't included)<br/>

## 🧪 Testing the project
At DIKU Group 6, we take testing seriously and make sure to run automated tests for every pull request merge on branches starting with the prefix "test/".

This allows us to keep track of our progress and ensure that the code is functioning correctly. You can view the latest test results on our [website](https://dikugroup6.github.io/) which is an automated process using GitHub Actions. 

We also use continuous integration through GitHub Actions to automatically run code coverage tests and update the website whenever someone makes a pull request with the test prefix.
