## üèóÔ∏è Building project
As mentioned above, this repository is mostly to myself, when implementing more complex features, or when wanting to test some new feature I usually go onto this playground and implement it before trying to implement it on the actual project. If you do wish to build the project to perhaps try some features or use it as you playground as well there's three steps to getting the program up and running. 

1. Clone the project <br/>
`git clone` https://github.com/DIKUGroup6/DIKUGames.git

2. Build the projects (Very important or else the assets isn't included)<br/>
`dotnet build`

3. Run dotnet <br/>
`dotnet run`
